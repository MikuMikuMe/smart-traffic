Creating a complete intelligent traffic management system involves complex components in computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data processing. Below is a simplified version of such a system using OpenCV for computer vision and a mock-up ML component for decision-making. Note this implementation lacks real-time capabilities and hardware integration, focusing rather on demonstrating concepts.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import time

# Mock function for machine learning decision (e.g., optimize traffic lights)
def optimize_traffic(congestion_level):
    """
    This function mimics a decision-making process based on congestion levels.
    Let's say levels range from 0 (no congestion) to 10 (heavy congestion).
    """
    try:
        if congestion_level < 3:
            return "Optimize for faster movement"
        elif 3 <= congestion_level < 7:
            return "Optimize for balanced flow"
        else:
            return "Optimize for congestion reduction"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in optimizing traffic: {e}")
        return "An error occurred in optimization"

def analyze_traffic_frame(frame):
    """
    Use computer vision to analyze traffic from a single frame.
    Returns a congestion level.
    """
    try:
        # Convert to grayscale for easier processing
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        # Use edge detection to identify potential vehicles
        edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150)
        
        # Mock processing to determine congestion level
        # More edges might imply more vehicles or congestion
        congestion_level = np.sum(edges) / (frame.shape[0] * frame.shape[1] * 255) * 10
        return int(congestion_level)
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error analyzing frame: {e}")
        return -1  # Indicate an error level

def main():
    # Initialize video capture (0 is the default camera, you may replace with video file)
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open video stream or file")
        return
    
    while True:
        try:
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                print("Failed to grab a frame")
                break

            # Analyze current frame
            congestion_level = analyze_traffic_frame(frame)
            if congestion_level == -1:
                print("Skipping frame due to error")
                continue
            
            # Make decision based on congestion level
            decision = optimize_traffic(congestion_level)
            print(f"Congestion Level: {congestion_level}, Decision: {decision}")

            # Display the resulting frame
            cv2.imshow('Traffic Monitoring', frame)

            # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                break

            # Simulate processing delay
            time.sleep(0.1)

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected error during main loop: {e}")
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Video Capture**: 
   - Captures video from the default camera using OpenCV. This can be modified to capture from a video file for testing purposes.

2. **Frame Analysis**:
   - Converts a frame to grayscale and uses the Canny edge detector to identify edges, which indirectly suggests vehicle presence.

3. **Congestion Estimation**:
   - A congestion level is estimated by checking the density of edges; more edges might imply more vehicles, hinting at congestion.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - A mock `optimize_traffic` function decides an action based on congestion levels. In practice, this would involve more sophisticated algorithms.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Captures common errors in video capture, frame processing, and decision logic, outputting them via print statements.

### Notes:
- This is a conceptual demonstration. A real implementation would integrate actual machine learning models trained on traffic data and require real-time processing capabilities.
- Testing this code would require setting up a corresponding environment: a camera or prerecorded video depicting traffic.
- This setup lacks complex handling such as lane detection, vehicle counting, movement prediction, and actual traffic light management which would appear in a full-scale application.
